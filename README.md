# Gandalf the Red 🧙‍♂️📜  
*“You shall not pass... without reading the privacy policy.”*

**Gandalf the Red** is a browser extension that helps you avoid unknowingly selling your soul in the terms and conditions.  
With the wisdom of wizards and some help from AI, it automatically detects privacy policies and terms of service, analyzes their risks, and delivers verdicts in a Middle-earth–themed interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Detection**: Finds privacy policies and terms of service on any website you visit  
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Analysis**: Evaluates legal documents and assigns letter grades (A–E)  
- 🌍 **Middle-earth Visuals**: Magical glowing indicators in a LOTR-inspired UI  
- ⚖️ **Clause Breakdowns**: Highlights both “Pro” and “Con” legal clauses  
- 📖 **Simple Language**: Translates legalese into plain English  
- 🧙‍♂️ **Gandalf Vibes**: Includes reactions, phrases, and references straight from the Grey Wizard himself (well, sort of)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Visit a website — Gandalf scans for Privacy Policy or Terms of Service links  
2. Documents are analyzed using an AI model (powered by OpenAI)  
3. A subtle alert pops up when results are ready  
4. Click the alert to reveal the full verdict:  
   - Letter grade  
   - Pro/Con clauses  
   - Plain-English explanations  
5. Make wiser choices (without needing to scroll through 20 pages of legalese)

|-------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| A     | Very Good (transparent, respects user rights)    | “Gandalf Smiles Upon You”    |
| B     | Good (minor issues, mostly user-friendly)        | “Second Breakfast Approved”  |
| C     | Average (some mildly problematic clauses)         | “Proceed with Caution”       |
| D     | Poor (many concerning or vague clauses)           | “The Eye of Sauron Watches”  |
