  "summary": "The document exhibits numerous concerning clauses, including broad license grants of user content, binding arbitration and class action waivers that limit legal rights, and insufficient transparency about data retention and third-party data sharing. While it contains some acknowledgment of user responsibility and property rights, it heavily favors the platform with little regard for user privacy or control. Overall, the policy raises significant privacy and rights issues, earning a D grade.",
