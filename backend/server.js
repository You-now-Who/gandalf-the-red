Once the Submission Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your Submission, but you may continue to update the project in your portfolio.A Poster may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of removing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Poster permits.(ii) Team and Organization RepresentativesIf a team or organization is entering a Hackathon, they must appoint and authorize one individual (the “Representative”) to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf. The Representative must meet the eligibility requirements for the Hackathon specified in the Official Rules.By entering a Submission on the Site on behalf of a team or organization, you represent and warrant that you are the Representative authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization.If there is a dispute over the identity of a Maker in a Hackathon on the Site, the email address used to enter the Hackathon and the person or entity assigned to that email address will be used to determine the Maker. The Poster and Devpost are not responsible for resolving any dispute between individuals or entities over the identity of the Maker. In the event of such a dispute, they may disqualify the disputed Submission and/or suspend or withdraw a prize.(iii) Responsibility for Hackathon SubmissionsYou are solely responsible for confirming that your Submission is complete and for making and storing copies or drafts of it.

The Poster and Devpost are not responsible for incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, lost, illegible, or incomprehensible Submissions or for address or email address changes of the Makers or Representatives. Proof of sending or submitting will not be deemed to be proof of receipt by a Poster or Devpost.If Devpost and/or a Poster determines that your Submission has not been received, or has been erroneously deleted, lost, destroyed or corrupted, you may request the opportunity to resubmit your Submission. However, you must make such a request promptly after you know or should have known there was a problem. Your request will be handled at the sole discretion of the Poster and/or Devpost.B. Determining Eligibility & Display of SubmissionsThe Poster has the right to require additional information. They also have the right to access any software application that is part of your Submission, in person or via any other reasonable manner, to verify that the software application functions and operates as described in other parts of your Submission, or to verify your role in creating the software.

Each person is limited to one vote per Submission and may only vote using one account. Makers may not directly or indirectly offer or pay any monetary or other form of consideration in exchange for a vote.You may not use any manual or automated vote process or methods, or multiple e-mail addresses, to circumvent the one-vote limit per person per Submission. Doing so will subject all of your votes to disqualification. The Poster may also disqualify a Maker, if the Maker receives multiple or irregular votes from the same user or users, receives votes in a manner that indicates manual, automated or other vote manipulation, or attempts to compensate voters.If the voting process fails to operate properly or appears to be tampered with or tainted with errors, fraud or unfair practices, the Poster has the right to determine any public voting prize winners by using non-suspect votes, or by any other means they deem appropriate. If no alternative means of determining a public voting winner prize is available or selected, the Poster may terminate any prize related to public voting without designating a winner.The Poster and Devpost are not responsible for, and are not required to count any vote which, in their judgment, is incomplete, late, misdirected, damaged, unlawful or illicit. This includes votes secured in breach of the voting rules above, as well as those lost for technical reasons, or otherwise in violation of this Agreement or the Official Rules.D.

APPLICABLE LAWThis Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.12. BINDING ARBITRATIONIn the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Content, the Site or the Services (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court in New York County, New York may enforce the arbitrator’s award. The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if applicable, or otherwise pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the “JAMS Rules”). Such disputes will be resolved by the arbitrator as determined under the JAMS Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. In addition, we may litigate in court to seek injunctive relief.13. CLASS ACTION WAIVERYou agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.14. SEVERABILITYIf any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.15.
